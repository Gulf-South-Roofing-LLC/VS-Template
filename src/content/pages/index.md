Each VidSock is uniquely created by the artist and then delivered to the world for their art to be altered and changed by its viewers thus making each VidSock truly dynamic.

Also, depending on the Artist's vision, they can choose to modify your NFT long after it has been minted and delivered to you. The artist has the flexibility to alter, add new items, or even completely change your individual art. Only your VidSock will have these totally unique modifications. Plus, each VidSock can be changed on a weekly basis or on special dates or occasions or even years later! It's up to the Artist and their vision for their VidSock.

Of course, you as the owner of the VidSock, always have the option to view both the new and the original versions at any time.
